# TwinkleToes

Welcome to the documentation for Twinkle Toes, a DIY audio effects pedal based on the [Daisy Seed.](https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed?variant=45234245108004z)

# Hardware

![diagram of twinkle toes](https://github.com/EinsteinUnicorn/TwinkleToes/blob/main/diagram.png)

The resistors are just current limiting resistors. You can be way more picky about choosing values to optimize for LED brightness, or you can just use a 1k resitor. 
There is a 1000uF cap at C2, and a 220uF cap at C3. The other capacitor slots are there in case you want to do additional filtering specific to your audio set up. The board works without them ;)

There are some places where the direction of the component matters. Namely the direction of the LEDs and the capacitors go. I have circles the holes where the Cathodes of the devices go. When assembling, please make sure that the short lead goes through the holes circled in Purple.

Also important to note, Pin 1 on the Daisy Seed should go in the hole marked pin one. If the Daisy Seed is not aligned this was it will not work :(

# Setting up a Development Environment for the TwinkleToes

To program the TwinkleToes, you will need to set up a development environment for developing on the Daisy eed. You can find documentation on how to do that [here.](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyWiki/wiki/1.-Setting-Up-Your-Development-Environment)

After you set up the development environment, you can create a new project to write your own hacky software to run on the board. There is some great documentation [here](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyWiki/wiki/1.-Setting-Up-Your-Development-Environment#to-make-your-own-daisy-project-checkout-the-create-a-new-project-wiki-page) on how to do this. 

You can now program Twinkle Toes just like you would a Daisy Seed, with some hardware already wired to certain pins. There is also space for you to access the Daisy Seed I/O should you want to repurpose the board ðŸ˜™

# Effects

This board is capable of leveraging the many different DSP techniques in the [Daisy Seed DSP library.](https://electro-smith.github.io/DaisySP/index.html) I urge anyone with this board to go through the Daisy Seed examples, and play around with what effects the board uses, and how they are used.
